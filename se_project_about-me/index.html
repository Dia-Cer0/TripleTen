          I like a good audiobook and if I'm really feeling
          the vibe I'll make some tea and physically turn the 
          pages of a physical book...yes they still exist XD.

        <p class="card-text two">
          I listen to just about every genre, but I have 
          been educating myself on electronic such as dark synth 
          (Off the top of my head "Insomnia" by Lorta & Awelies is a straight banger ).

        <p class="card-text three">
          I have worked electrical maintenance at a steel mill for just over 5 years now.
          It's not usually a job that you fall into, but that's what sort of happened to me.
          I was getting layed off at my previous job and with little experience I just needed a job.
          The pay and benefits turned out to be really good and I have learned a lot about working with people 
          in general not to mention building a decent work ethic. Even though I have growned trememdously through this role
          I am ready to start paving the way to something I have real long-term interest and a passion for. I'm not afraid
          to bust a few knuckles if that's what it takes and I am no stranger to a keyboard.

        <p class="card-text four">
          I have always been interested in all things computers. My first interest in software 
          career wise was while I was in college for electrical engineering. By the time I 
          realized that my interest in software outweighed that of my interest in electricity I was already graduated and working.
          I aim to steal every possible moment to make my dream a reality.
