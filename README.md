## commit format

### feat

introduces a new feature to your project. This includes any complete block of code that performs its task. It can be a complete header, footer, news aggregator, etc.

### fix

patches a bug in your code. For example, a broken link is an error, and changing the href attribute value in HTML will fix it.

### style

changes the appearance of your code. It has nothing to do with adding new features and doesn't affect the meaning of the code. This includes whitespace, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.

### refactor

restructures your code. It neither fixes bugs nor adds new features. Example: changing the order of writing CSS properties in selectors, or breaking a JS function into several smaller ones.

eg.
git commit -m "feat: add responsive for smartphones and tablets"
